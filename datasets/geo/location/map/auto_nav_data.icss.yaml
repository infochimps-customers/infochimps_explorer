    description: |-
      Map data constructed from shapefiles from Automotive Navigation Data(AND.com).
      AND is a leading provider of digital mapping data used for navigation and location-based services.
      AND focuses on the development of digital mapping data in Europe, North-Africa, Central and South America and Australia.
      The digital maps are used in personal and 'in-car' navigation, Internet-based mapping, fleet management and more.
      Our API allows you to search against this data by location, returning a vector map and other locationary data as a result.
