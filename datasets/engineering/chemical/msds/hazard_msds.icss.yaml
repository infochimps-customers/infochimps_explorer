          pH indicates whether a solution is acidic, basic or neutral. The corresponding ranges are:
            1. Acidic - the pH is between zero and 7.0
            2. Neutral - the pH is 7.0
            3. Basic (also called alkaline) - the pH is between 7.0 and 14.

        type: string
        doc: |-
          Flash points are determined experimentally by heating the liquid in a container and then introducing a small flame just above
          the liquid surface. The temperature at which there is a flash/ignition is recorded as the flash point. Two general methods are
          called closed-cup and open-cup. The closed-cup method prevents vapors from escaping and therefore usually results in a flash
          point that is a few degrees lower than in an open cup. Because the two methods give different results, one must always list
          the testing method when listing the flash point. Example: 110 oC (closed cup). Source: http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/flashpoint.html

          An LC50 value is the concentration of a material in air that will kill 50% of the test subjects
          (animals, typically mice or rats) when administered as a single exposure (typically 1 or 4 hours).
          Also called the  median lethal concentration and lethal concentration 50, this value gives you an
          idea of the relative acute toxicity of an inhalable material. This is closely related to the LCLo
          value which is the lowest concentration reported to have killed animals or humans. This value applies
          to vapors, dusts, mists and gases. Solids and liquids use the closely related LD50 value
          (50% lethal dose). Source: http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/lc50.html

          An LD50 value is the amount of a solid or liquid material that it takes to kill 50% of test animals
          (for example, mice or rats) in one dose. This is closely related to the LDLo value which is the lowest
          dosage reported to have killed animals or humans. LC50 (50% lethal concentration) is a related term
          used for gases, dusts, vapors, mists etc. Source: http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/ld50.html
