        The Problem: Making meaningful development data for your application.

        The Solution: A fake data generator that does more than just lorem ipsum and random text (well, it does those too, but also does much more).

        Forgery generates fake data from dictionaries, formats, and recipes. The plugin includes a generator providing directories to make your own forgeries.
