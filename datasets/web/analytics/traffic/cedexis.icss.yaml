        h2. Network Provider Statistics

        
        Given a @network@ and a @provider@ provides up to 15 distinct measurements of web traffic statistics, as reported by "Cedexis":http://www.cedexis.com
        
        Every day, the Cedexis Radar community collects over 450 million measurements, based on the experiences of actual end-users around the world.

        h3. Measurements

        Measurements include

        * Network availability
        * SSL Response Time
        * SSL Custom measurement
        * SSL Connect Time
        * RTMP Connect Time
        * HTTP Custom Measurement
        * RTMP Buffer
        * HTTP Connect Time
        * HTTP Response Time
        * SSL Throughput
        * HTTP Large Files
        * HTTP Throughput
        * RTMP Throughput

        h3. Usage

        In order to find the provider of interest first use the @provider_lookup@ call. This allows you to query on a string, eg. "Yahoo.com"
        an get back an array of possible providers along with key to use when querying the @network_provider_stats@ call.

        Additionally, to find the network(s) of interest use the @network_lookup@ call. This allows you to query on a string and get back
        an array of matching networks along with their keys to use when querying the @network_provider_stats@ call. For example, using "Africa"
        would return all networks in Africa.
