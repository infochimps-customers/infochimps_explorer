      description: |-
        Discover how commonly used a given word is on Twitter.

        
        There are two relevant metrics that describe a word’s usage. The first is simply a usage frequency, measured as a fraction of
        the full corpus of text on Twitter in parts per billion. The second describes how dispersed the word’s usage is among all Twitter users.
        As an example, the word “the” has a very high usage frequency while the word “tintinnabulation” has a very low usage frequency. As for
        dispersion, consider the words “pajamas” and “lawsuit”, both of which have similar usage frequencies. Many, many people talk about pajamas
        and so “pajamas” has high dispersion. Comparably few people talk about lawsuits and so “lawsuit” has low dispersion (these people must say
        “lawsuit” a lot, though, in order to give it the same overall usage frequency as “pajamas”).
