        h3. Twitter User Influence Metrics


        This call provides the most powerful analytics available on almost any Twitter user. Determine a user’s value, reputation, and
        influence or filter spam. See who who holds the most ReTweeting cachet and who is most likely to respond to an @mention. See trst.me
        for an example.

        Some example use cases could be:

          * For community managers, target who amongst your community is most active on Twitter.
          * For marketers/advertisers, identify who the main influencers are within a community that is the ideal market for your product/service.
            See who is most likely to respond to a random @mention because they might have high Chattiness rating, or who would have the highest
            value tweet because they have high Sway.

        If you have questions about how any of this data was computed or need any more information, please email info@infochimps.com or visit
        our help page

        h3. Trstrank


        The Infochimps Trstrank measures how important a Twitter user is. It's a "sophisticated network measure of centrality":http://trst.me/about, not just a
        count of the number of followers a user has. It ranges between 0 and 10 and is "logarithmically distributed":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#Logarithmic_scale
        so "@BarackObama"http://trst.me/t/BarackObama 's 9.9 makes him many times more important than "@ShashiTharoor":http://trst.me/t/ShashiTharoor 's 8.9.
          
        h3. TrstQuotient

        
        A metric to help differentiate between users of similar Trstrank.
        The TrstQuotient is an integer between 0 and 100 that quantifies the relationship between a user's Trstrank and their follower count.  It indicates how
        _normal_ a user's Trstrank is, given his number of followers.  A very-low TrstQuotient can be a sign of a spammy or abusive Twitter account. More followers usually means
        a higher Trstrank, but it's possible for two Twitter users to have a similar Trstrank but vastly different numbers of followers.  Vastly fewer followers for a comparable
        Trstrank says a user's followers are themselves pretty trustworthy which reflects back well upon the user. As an example, consider NY Times columnist and two-time Pulitzer
        Prize winner "@NickKristof":http://trst.me/t/NickKristof, who's able to score a impressive Trstrank of 7.29 with a meager 1 million followers.  His TrstQuotient is 80.
        Compare him with in-again-out-again pop diva "@BritneySpears":http://trst.me/t/BritneySpears whose horde of over 5 million followers grants her a Trstrank score of 8.07,
        only a little bit higher than @NickKristof.  Britney's TrstQuotient is a meager 20.  (Conclusions about the general trustworthiness of NY Times readers and Britney Spears
        fans left to the reader.)

        h3. Use Cases:

          
        * Filter influencers/non-influencers
        ** A high trstQuotient (> 70) is an indication of an important person.

        * Spam Filtering
        ** A low trstQuotient (< 30) is an indication of a spammy account.

      - name: enthusiasm
        type: float
        doc: >-
          (retweets_out / tweets_out) – Retweets (RT) per tweet

          The enthusiasm score typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and signifies the fraction of times a user’s
          tweet is a retweet (RT) of another Twitter user.

          (@mentions_in / tweets_out).

          Mentions are not directly linked to a user’s tweets out, but they do give an idea of the influence of a user.
          An interesting score of greater than 1.0 signifies the user is interesting to the Twitter community, in that
          the community reacts to the things that user tweets about and often shares things with them.

      - name: chattiness
        type: float
        doc: >-
          (@mentions_out / tweets_out) – @sign mentions per tweet.

          Users with high chattiness are more likely to reference other members of the Twitter community.
          A chattiness score near 1.0 signifies that, on average, each tweet contains a mention.

      - name: sway
        type: float
        doc: >-
          (retweets_in / tweets_out) – Retweets (RT) per tweet

          The Twitter community follows a user with high sway closely and is likely to react to the things that they tweet about.
          A sway near 1.0 signifies that, on average, each tweet by the user is retweeted by another person in the Twitter community.

        doc: >-
          <code>(observed_num_friends/twitter_supplied_num_friends)</code> – The rate at which you unfollow other Twitter users.

          
          Some Twitter users will follow many people indiscriminately, wait until the person follows them back, and then unfollow them.
          In doing so, they hope that having 300 followers and only following 25 will get people to notice them by inflating their
          follower-to-following ratio. Twitter works hard to discourage this “aggressive churning”, as it is considered a form of spamming.

          
          As an example, if we have historically observed you following a total of 300 people, but your current friends count is only 50,
          then you have a follow churn of 6.0 = 300 / 50. A follow churn of greater than 1.0 is a sign of a shady character, as there is a
          large discrepancy between their current following number and their historic activity. A follow churn of significantly less than
          should 1.0 can be ignored, as it implies that we have an incomplete picture of the user’s friend graph. A normal Twitter user has
          a follow churn of 1.0, or within a small margin of it.
