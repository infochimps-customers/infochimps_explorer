-# Note: this partial is SHARED between george and apey_eye. Please DO NOT
-# introduce any coupling between these partials and the rest of george, and be
-# VERY CONSERVATIVE in your use of rails view helpers.
-#
-# The true canonical version of this file is the one that lives in george. The
-# apey_eye team has responsibility to pull upstream changes, the george team
-# has the responsibility to make these straightforward.
-#
-# If this request conflicts with being effective, then a) be effective, b) talk
-# to flip so he can help find a workaround
-#    
-# To airlift this into apeyeye: change all occurences of 'render' with 'render'
-# (and vice versa in george)
